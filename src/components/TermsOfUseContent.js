      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: 'rgb(0, 0, 10)', textAlign: 'center'}}><strong>Last updated April 26, 2021</strong></p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISION TO CLAIM BPRO TOKENS AS THEY AFFECT YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WAIVERS OF RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>PLEASE ALSO CAREFULLY READ THE TERMS OF USE APPLICABLE TO THE WEBSITE (<u><a href="https://app.bprotocol.org/terms">https://app.bprotocol.org/terms</a></u>) AND TO BPROTOCOL (<u><a href="https://github.com/backstop-protocol/Terms-and-Conditions">https://github.com/backstop-protocol/Terms-and-Conditions</a></u>), INCORPORATED HEREIN.</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BY CLAIMING BPRO TOKENS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE FULLY READ, UNDERSTAND AND IRREVOCABLY ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BPRO tokens are only intended for sophisticated users who are knowledgeable and experienced in cryptocurrencies, blockchain and Ethereum technologies and protocols. By claiming, holding, or using BPRO tokens you accept all risks in connection therewith.</p>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BPRO tokenizes the governance of BProtocol, enabling the transfer and redistribution of voting rights. The decision to tokenize governance was made by vote of the users of BProtocol who held user rating scores (mScore and cScore), which controlled 100% of the governance vote that determined to create BPRO (the “Genesis vote”).</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BPRO is available to Users based on their mScore and cScore. Users do not have any obligation to claim BPRO. Participation in distributions from the “jar” will continue to be based on the non-transferable mScore and cScore without regard to whether a user claims, holds, or uses BPRO.</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BPRO tokens do not represent a stock, commodity, or any other investment instrument. No payment of financial contribution to SFL or any other person or entity is necessary to claim BPRO, and it does not entitle the holder to any payment of any kind.</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>There is no fixed supply of BPRO and the future amount of BPRO is unknowable. The vote to create BPRO established continuous minting of additional BPRO pursuant to a defined schedule over a 4-year period. That determination could be modified by a subsequent proposal and vote of BPRO holders, and what transpires after the period contemplated by the Genesis vote will be subject to a future vote of BPRO holders.</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BProtocol was initially created by Smart Future Labs (“SFL”), but SFL had already distributed 100% of the voting control to users prior to the Genesis vote. SFL did not decide to create BPRO or vote in the Genesis vote, and BPRO has no control over the future minting of BPRO.</p>

      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BPRO may not be available or appropriate for use in certain jurisdictions. By claiming, holding, or using BPRO, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that may apply to you. You may not claim BPRO if you are a citizen, resident, or member of any jurisdiction or group that are designated as high risk by the Financial Action Task Force, that are subject to embargos or sanctions implemented by the United Nations, Israel, the European Union, or the Office of Foreign Asset Control of the United States Treasury Department, or are included on a list of jurisdictions not permitted to use the B-Protocol Services as determined by SFL (each, a “Prohibited Jurisdiction”), or if your use of the B-Protocol Services would be illegal or otherwise violate any applicable law. You may not use BPRO in connection with or which would involve proceeds of any unlawful activity.</p>

      </ol>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>BPRO are transferable but there is no established market for BPRO and no assurance that one will develop or that BPRO will have any monetary value now or in the future. You also have no right to return the BPRO in exchange for anything. By claiming BPRO, you acknowledge that BPRO are intended for the purpose of governing BProtocol and that you are not claiming them in reliance on any expectation that they will have future market value or that SFL or its affiliates, or any other person, will undertake any steps to create a market for BPRO or increase its value.</p>
      <p style={{marginBottom: '0.17in', color: '#00000a', textAlign: 'left'}}>The regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrencies and cryptographic tokens, including BPRO, is fast evolving. There may be uncertainty in the regulatory treatment of BPRO in certain jurisdictions. Although the Company does not believe that BPRO tokens are securities in any jurisdiction, there is no assurance that relevant competent government or regulatory authorities (“Relevant Authorities”) would take a similar view, either now or in the future. Similarly, although the Company does not believe that creating, offering, or claiming BPRO is subject to any securities, commodities, derivatives or other financial law and regulation (collectively, “Regulations”), there is no guarantee that the Relevant Authorities may not subsequently determine that BPRO tokens are subject to Regulation and/or were not in compliance with certain Regulations. Any such different view or determination by Relevant Authorities may impose restrictions on the transfer and utility of BPRO tokens and other regulatory requirements.</p>
